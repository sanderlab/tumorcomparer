In the last week of the project, we were working on final merging and doing some minor changes to make sure that the package is passing the unit tests. I have detected some artifacts which can be discussed in the future. 

## Work Progress

1. **Minor updated in uint tests**  
    Status: **Done**    
    **Commit:** [Replaced expect_identical function to expect_equal](https://github.com/hakobyansiras/tumorcomparer/commit/d1739191602638dcf2e2a5673a1ce79b17cec777)

2. **Issues with comparison results distance matrix**  
    Status: **In progress**    
    **Issue:** [Some distance values in distance matrix are higher than 1](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/28)

## Conclusion

It was a great experience to work with Augustin Luna during the coding period. I did some minor changes and now the package is passing all unit tests.
