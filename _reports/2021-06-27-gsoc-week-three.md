This week I was working on the generalization of the run comparison function. The task was to optimize the function and generalize function inputs that the comparison function can get any type of dataset. 

## Work Progress

1. **Generalize run_comparison function**   
    Status÷â **Done**    
    **Issue:** [Generalize run_comparison.R Code](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/6)

2. **Generate synthetic data for testing of the new function**  
    Status: **Under Development**    
    **Issue:** [Make a test for 5 data types](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/10)

## Conclusion  

This week was really productive and I have managed to develop the required function which is more optimized and can get any type of dataset.
