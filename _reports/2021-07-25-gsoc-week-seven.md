I have added documentation for the new functions and modified unit tests for the comparison functions which have been updated by mentor. 

## Work Progress

1. **Documentation for new functions**  
    Status: **Done**    
    **Issue:** [Add Documentation to run_comparison_config_list](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/9)

## Conclusion
I have pushed the updated code and all the updates successfully passed the testing. In the next weeks, I will work on network construction and shiny based network visualization tasks.
