This part of the work is dedicated to the development of a function that will construct a graphNEL network from a distance matrix based on a specified threshold. The next step was to visualize the graph with the cyjShiny package in the R Shiny application.

## Conclusion  

This week I was intensively working on the network construction and visualization part. It was really hard to work with the new package which lacks documentation and error handling. However, with the help of my mentor, I managed to overcome all problems and finish the task.
