I have integrated precalculated geneset comparison results into the “Pre-Computed Analysis” section of the shiny app. Now users can get comparison plots between cancer and cell lines not only for specified cancer type but also by specified pathway.

## Work Progress

1. **Integrate Gene Set Analysis into Shiny App**  
    Status: **Done**    
    **Issue:** [Integrate Gene Set Analysis into Shiny App](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/14)

1. **Missing values and exceptions**  
    Status: **In progress**    
    **Issue:** [NaN values in geneset comparisons](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/21)

## Conclusion  

I have added a new feature to the shiny app and detected a combination of cancers and pathways where mutation data comparison is failed.
